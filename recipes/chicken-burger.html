        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <strong>For the Chicken</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless boneless chicken thigh fillets</li>
            <li>large piece of ginger, finely grated</li>
            <li>100g cornflour</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
    
    <strong>For the sauce</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>6 tbsp dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Korean chilli paste</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    <li>small piece ginger, grated</li>
    <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Method</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce, put all the ingredients in a saucepan and simmer gently until syrupy. Take off the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut away any fatty excess from the chicken thighs, then season with salt, pepper and the grated ginger. Toss the chicken with the cornflour until completely coated.</li>
        <li>Heat about 2cm of vegetable oil in a large frying pan. Fry the chicken thighs for 4-5 mins each side until crisp. Remove from the oil onto kitchen paper and leave to cool slightly for 2 mins. Then re-fry in the hot oil until ultra-crisp and you can hear it crackle. Remove to kitchen paper to drain.</li>
        <li>Reheat the sauce. Build your burgers by placing some lettuce and kimchi slaw on the base of a bun, top with the crispy chicken and drizzle over the sticky sauce.</li>
    </ol>
